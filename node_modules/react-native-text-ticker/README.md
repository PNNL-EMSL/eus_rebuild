## Description
Inspired from the great [react-native-marquee](https://github.com/kyo504/react-native-marquee), this module acts similarly but with a few extra features and props:

- Don't scroll the text if it fits in the container
- Infinitely scroll text in a ticker fashion
- Bounce text from side to side if it's only slightly wider than its container
- Grab the text and scroll it manually

To see it in action check out the example!

This package aims to only support the latest version of React-Native.

## Installation
```
npm install --save react-native-text-ticker
or
yarn add react-native-text-ticker
```

## Usage
This module can be used as a drop in replacement for the react-native `Text` component (extra props optional).

```
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'
import TextTicker from 'react-native-text-ticker'

export default class Example extends PureComponent {
  render(){
    return(
      <View style={style.container}>
        <TextTicker
          style={{ fontSize: 24 }}
          duration={3000}
          loop
          bounce
          repeatSpacer={50}
          marqueeDelay={1000}
        >
          Super long piece of text is long. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
        </TextTicker>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

```
